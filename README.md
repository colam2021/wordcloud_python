# wordcloud_python
This is a final project of the Google Crash Course on Python. It took me a year to complete the course because it's hard to me. Half way through, I decided to stop and took the P4E first. After taking 2 P4E courses, I went back to the course. Felt slightly better. Still lots of challenges. This time, I started to keep calm and tackle each difficulty one by one.  I started to break each diffiulty into smaller parts.  Also, instead of looking for answers, I looked for ways to deal with the small parts. Finally, I was able to completed the course before the end of 2021. What a long journey.  
 
This project is to create a wordcloud by building a dictionary with words and frequencies. The project did help me to understand more about dictionary in python.

When doing string exercises, whether it's R or Python, I found many will use classic novel or president's speech. That's fine.  But to me, I want to use current social materials.  Therefore, I decided to use Chapter One from the "Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada."
